## 2024-05-23 - Icon-Only Buttons
**Learning:** Icon-only buttons (like "Get Started" or language switchers) are a recurring accessibility issue. They often rely on `title` attributes which are insufficient for screen readers.
**Action:** Always check `Navbar` and header components for icon-only buttons and enforce `aria-label` usage.
